# Career Aspiration Prediction using Machine Learning
# Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting a student’s career aspiration based on academic performance, study habits, attendance, and extracurricular involvement using machine learning classification techniques.
The system analyzes multiple subject scores along with behavioral attributes to recommend a suitable career path.

The project follows a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment readiness.
#  Problem Statement

Students often struggle to identify a suitable career path despite having strong academic and behavioral indicators.
This project aims to assist in career guidance by learning patterns from historical student data and predicting potential career aspirations.
# Technologies & Tools Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data cleaning and preprocessing

Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

Pickle – Model persistence

Streamlit – Interactive web application (optional deployment)
